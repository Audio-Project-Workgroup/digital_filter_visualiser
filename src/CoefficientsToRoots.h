	public:
		/*	Method used to convert polynomial coefficients into roots using a QR method.
			Consists of the following steps:
				- Preprocessing:
					- Filter out leading zeros if any
					- Filter out trailing zeros if any
					- Build companion matrix of Hessenberg form from given coefficients
					- Calculate rayleigh quotient shift 
				- apply shifted QR iterations (starting from bottom right) with deflation when subdiagonal entries become ~0
						- Step 1 calculate Q0 via Gram Schmidt orthogonalization method
						- Step 2 calculate R0 :  R0 = Q0 A0
						- Step 3 calculate A1 : A1 = R0 Q0
						- Step 4 add shift back in A1 and check sub-diagonal entries for deflation
				- Extract eigenvalues:
					- merge roots that have smaller scaled difference than tolerance
					- scan subdiagonal:
						- if values on the subdiagonal smaller than Epsilon, then real root
						- else 2 solutions. Solve det(A - λI) = 0 for 2x2 square matrix:
							- if discriminant >= 0, then two real solutions
							- else then root has a complex conjugate (conjugate is not appended on returned vector, as this is done automatically when using FilterState::add to add that root in the Value tree)
			Returns complex roots paired with their corresponding order.
